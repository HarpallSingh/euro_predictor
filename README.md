# Euro 2024 Match Outcome Predictor

Welcome to the Euro 2024 Match Outcome Predictor! This project aims to predict the outcomes of upcoming Euro 2024 championship soccer matches based on historical data.

Overview
Predicting the outcome of soccer matches is a complex task that involves analyzing historical match data, team performance, and various other factors. This project utilizes a machine learning approach to forecast the results of upcoming matches. Specifically, we use a Random Forest classifier, which is well-suited for handling the non-linear relationships and diverse feature types inherent in sports data.

Models and Methods
Random Forest Classifier
The primary model used for prediction in this project is the Random Forest classifier. This model is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the mode of the classes for classification. The Random Forest classifier is chosen for its robustness to overfitting and its ability to handle various feature types effectively.

Feature Engineering
Key features used in the model include:

Home Win Rate: The historical win rate of the home team when playing at home.
Away Win Rate: The historical win rate of the away team when playing away.
These features are derived from historical match data, providing insights into team performance under different conditions.
